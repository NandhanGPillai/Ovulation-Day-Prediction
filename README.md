# Develop an Ovulation Calculator Using Python

Implementing an Ovulation Calculator to precisely determine the day of ovulation.

# Motivation

I embarked on this project with the noble intention of aiding individuals who have encountered challenges in identifying their ovulation day and simplifying their life planning. By creating this solution, I sought to alleviate the burden of uncertainty and offer a reliable tool that empowers users to make informed decisions regarding their reproductive health, family planning, and overall well-being. It is my aspiration that this project eases the journey for those in need, fostering a sense of control and confidence in their life choices.

# Description

The calculator takes user inputs for the first date of their last menstrual period and the length of their menstrual cycle and subsequently generates and displays the estimated ovulation date.
