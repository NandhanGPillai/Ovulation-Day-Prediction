I embarked on this project with the noble intention of aiding individuals who have encountered challenges in identifying their ovulation day and simplifying their life planning. By creating this solution, I sought to alleviate the burden of uncertainty and offer a reliable tool that empowers users to make informed decisions regarding their reproductive health, family planning, and overall well-being. It is my aspiration that this project eases the journey for those in need, fostering a sense of control and confidence in their life choices
